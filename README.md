**👋 Hi here, I'm ZeYiLin(林泽毅 in Chinese)**

Now, I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/) , under the guidance of Prof. [Wu Jiaji](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/wujj/), and also a co-founder of [SwanHub](https://swanhub.co) and [SwanLab](https://github.com/SwanHubX/SwanLab). I am passionate about working in a full-stack capacity, with a love for **ML**, **UI&UX**, and **Product Management**. Currently, my focus is on building [@SwanLab](https://github.com/SwanHubX/SwanLab), aiming to create a new collaborative approach to AI research.

The [HivisionIDphotos](https://github.com/zeyi-lin/hivisionidphotos) project originated from my reflections and product practices in the ID photo and copying industry in 2021. It was open-sourced in 2023 and has gained love from over 10k web engineers, AI researchers, system integrators, photographers, and professionals from various fields.

***”我对HivisionID开源的最大期望，是用轻量级的AI技术，赋能更多人在人工智能时代看到新的机会，很开心这件事正在发生“***

***"My greatest expectation for the open source of HivisionID is to empower more people to see new opportunities in the era of artificial intelligence with lightweight AI technology. I am very happy that this is happening."***
