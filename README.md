**ðŸ‘‹ Hi here, I'm ZeYiLin(æž—æ³½æ¯… in Chinese)**

Now, I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/) , under the guidance of Prof. [Wu Jiaji](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/wujj/), and also a co-founder of [SwanLab](https://github.com/SwanHubX/SwanLab). I am passionate about working in a full-stack capacity, with a love for **ML**, **Product**, and **UI&UX**. Currently, my focus is on building [@SwanLab](https://github.com/SwanHubX/SwanLab), aiming to create a new collaborative approach to AI research.
