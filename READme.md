**Hi here, I'm ZeYiLin(林泽毅 in Chinese)**

Now, I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/) ,and also a co-founder of [SwanHub](swanhub.co). I am passionate about working in a full-stack capacity, with a love for **ML**, **UI&UX**, and **product management**. Currently, my focus is on building [@SwanLab](https://github.com/SwanHubX/SwanLab), aiming to create a new collaborative approach to AI research.
